# Project Overview


## Project Description

### Game Concepts:

#### Pizza Now!
  * You run the best pizzeria in town! However, in order to stay #1, you have to keep your rating at 5 stars by making sure the foodbloggers get their slice before they make their way to the counter to follow up on their order.  
  * Use the left and right arrow keys to get to the specific counter and use the spacebar to serve a slice.  
  * After you have served all the foodbloggers during the lunch rush, you'll get to keep your title as the best place pizza place in New York!

#### Little Town of Horrors!
  * Oh no! It looks like skid row has been overrun by Audrey Twos and they are all VERY hungry! Save the day by zapping out these cannibal alien plants!
  * Use the left and right arrow keys to get to the laser beams and use the spacebar to zap before the Audrey Twos get to the barrier!
  * After you have killed all these extra-terrestrial vegetation mutations- you've saved the town- and maybe finally get Audrey to notice you.
