        <p>You run the best pizzeria in town! However, in order to stay #1, you have to keep your rating at 5 stars by making sure the foodbloggers get their pizza before they make their way to the counter to complain.</p>
        <p>Use the left and right arrow keys to get to the specific counter and use the spacebar to serve your pie.</p>
        <p>After you have served all the foodbloggers during the lunch rush, you'll get to keep your title as "The Best Pizza Place In New York"!</p>
